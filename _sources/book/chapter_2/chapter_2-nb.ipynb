    "Quantum computing is a field of computer science that harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to solve computational problems.\n",

    "Linear algebra is the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics&mdash;the study of the behavior of quantum states and their transformations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, it is imperative to understand linear algebra, or more generally of vector spaces, to be able to work with and reason about quantum systems in quantum computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum mechanics is inherently a linear theory. It treats quantum states as vectors that live in a Hilbert vector space. The state of a quantum system can change to another state vector and this change is a linear transformation. The change in the quantum state brought about by the passage of time is also a linear transformation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we present a quick review of the basic linear algebra needed to traverse the world of quantum computing and quantum theory in general. We wil relearn vectors, vectors spaces, and linear transformations at a more general setting. "
