    "the answer to be a 'yes' or a 'no'. It is also amount of information you gain when the result of a\n",

    "represents one of the two possible options while the digit $ \\texttt{1} $ represents the other \n",

    "more than two states. For example, for a system that can be in one of four possible states $ A, B,\n",

    "represent state $A$,  $01$ can represent state $B$, $10$ can represent state $C$, and \n",

    "identical. In the quantum version of the experiment, the initial states of the quantum systems are \n",
    "still identical and the same preparation procedure is performed for all systems. We also note that \n",
